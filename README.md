## Problems
1. Sliding window (my goal was to look at each value only once and don't keep whole input in memory)
2. Movement simulation (my goal was to have as few ifs as possible)
3. Binary tree traversal (unnecessary optimization)
4. Game simulation
5. Sweep line
6. Neat simulation / Matrix exponentiation
7. Ternary search
8. Frequency table
9. Flood fill
